# Nathan John Giose
# I will be creating a list of names so that we can have a reference in the loop
# So names is now considered a variable of an array.


names = ["Nathan John", "Abdul-Malik", "Tashwill", "Mujaid", "Uthmaan"]
# Now we're going to call our variable
# Please pay attention to where you put in the colon (because I often forget to put in the colon...lol)


for name in names:
    # Something that's a real pain, is the indexing of the loop
    # If you screw up your spacing, it's almost over for you
    # But you will be saved with 4 spaces, tab, or backspace first word of the new line...
    # to the last word on the previous line and then hit enter.


    print("The current name is", name)
