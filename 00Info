As I was working through my end of module assignment,
I got a bit confused with how to do loops with lists and dictionaries.

So to make it easier, I started from scratch to give you a bit of insight
to how I am structurally learning it again. Don't get me wrong though, I know
how to do it- I just get confused here and there- an I am positive others do too!

A heads up, with the Arithmetic Operator "=", it gets me off guard lol...
You assign a variable to a list in the following way-
Value = ["This", "Is", "A", "List"]
And this is how my circuit memory put it in-
Not_Value: ["This", "Is", "Not", "Going", "To", "Create", "A", "List"]
Y'all feel me!?
Keep this kinky errors in mind when you see an error that say,
"The following operator is not assigned..." or something like that.
